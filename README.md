In case a Quarter is empty, ignore that for turn order purposes. 

During setup a player may pick whichever Quarter she wants from those left.
Often this will mean picking the highest in turn order.

## Gameplay
Each Round will comprise of the Order Phase, where players take actions, the Income Phase, the Construction Phase, and the Cleanup Phase.

### Order Phase
In the Order Phase players may perform one of the following actions

* Move Goons
* Hire Goons
* Cast Spell

#### Move Goons
A player may pay 1 gold to move a group of goons from one tile to a any other tile.
All goons moved must come from the same space, but not all goons on that space has to be moved.
When moving, the goons must move one tile at a time, following the roads (the rings on edges of City Tiles).
The group cannot split up while moving.
If the group ends in a location where there are any enemy goons, the players must decide to fight or not.
If both players decide to not fight, the group of goons may remain where they are or continue there move.

If just one player decides to fight, the movement ends, and the two groups of Goons will fight.

If two players have Goons on the same space, and a third player moves in, the players will have to decide whether to fight in player order.
Only two players will ever have a fight at a time.

##### Fighting
When fighting, the player moving into the area is considered the attacker.
Starting with the attacker, and taking turns, the players will either kill 1 Goon or retreat all their Goons.

When killing a Goon, the opponent removes one Goon of their choice.

If retreating, a player may move all their remaining Goons one tile away, following the normal movement rules.
This move costs no gold, but has to follow the roads.
Retreating may trigger additional fighting.

After resolving all fighting in an area, if control of the area changed, place 1 Uprising Token on the City Tile.

##### Controlling an area
If multiple players have Goons in an area, the player with the most Goons have control.
If the players have the same amount of Goons in an area, nobody controls the area.

##### Uprising
If a City Tile has 3 or more Uprising Tokens, remove all Goons from the tile.
Players can no longer leave Goons in this tile and nobody can control the tile.

##### Wounded Goons
All players have a total of 15 Goons available throughout the game.
When a Goon is killed, it is not returned to the pool of available Goons.
Rather the killed Goon is considered wounded.

A player must heal a wounded Goon before they again can place it on the board.

#### Hire Goons
A player may pay 1 gold per Goon they want to add to the board.
For each gold paid a player may add 1 Goon to any area on the board they already control.
If placing multiple Goons, the Goons must be placed on the same City Tile.

#### Cast Spell
A player may pay money to cast a spell.
The first spell in the Spell Queue cost 1 coin, and every spell after the first increase in price by 1 for each 'step'.
When casting a spell, follow the spell instructions and then move the spell to the back of the Spell Queue.

### Income Phase
All players gain money based on the value of the areas they control.

Then players may spend money to heal goons.
Two goons may be healed for 1 gold.
This may be done as many times as desired.

### Construction Phase
The player controlling the Keep secretly draws the top two City Tiles, places one back on top of the stack and the other face up on the table.
If there is only one City Tile left in the stack when the player must draw, simply reveal that tile.

Then the player controlling the Keep, initiaties an auction for placing the City Tile into the city.
This player may start the bidding at any value, and going in player order around the table, players will either raise the bid or pass.
Once a player has passed, that player is out of the round.

The winner of the bid places the City Tile into the city and may put up to 2 goons unto the tile.

If nobody controls the keep, the player with the least gold initiates the auction.

#### Placing. a City Tile

* The rings on the edges of the tile must match.
* The tile must be placed next to two other tiles if possible.

### Cleanup Phase

* Remove all lone Street Rats.
* Remove the Golem
* Remove the Shield Token

## End Game
The game ends when 1 player has 50 gold or when no City Tile can be flipped in the Construction Phase (5 rounds).
The Player with the most money wins.
If multiple players have the same amount of money, ties are broken by controlling Quarters in reverse order.
